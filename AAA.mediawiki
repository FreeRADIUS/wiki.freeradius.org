An [[AAA]] Server is a server or servers that provide [[authentication]], [[authorization]] and [[accounting]] services. These may be co-located with the [[NAS]], or more typically, are located on a separate server and communicate with the [[NAS]]'s User Management Interface via an [[AAA]] protocol.  The three [[AAA]] functions may be located on a single server, or may be broken up among multiple servers.
