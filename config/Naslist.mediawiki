The '''naslist''' file in the FreeRADIUS configuration directory (raddb/) used to contain the list of every NAS (Network Access Server, also known as terminal server), with an abbreviated name and the type of NAS it is.

'''This file is obsolete and has been removed in all current releases.'''

The old-style FreeRADIUS supported the following NAS types:

{| class="wikitable"
! Terminal Server !! Type in naslist
|-
| 3Com/USR Hiper Arc Total Control || usrhiper
|-
| 3Com/USR NetServer || netserver
|-
| 3Com/USR TotalControl || tc
|-
| Ascend Max 4000 family || max40xx
|-
| Ascend MaxTNT || ascend
|-
| Cisco Access Server family || cisco
|-
| Cistron PortSlave || portslave
|-
| Computone PowerRack || computone
|-
| Cyclades PathRAS || pathras
|-
| Livingston PortMaster || livingston
|-
| Multitech CommPlete Server || multitech
|-
| Patton 2800 family || patton
|}

Usually this was the same list as in the "[[clients]]" file, but not every NAS is a client and not every client is a NAS.

'''This functionality is now in /etc/raddb/[[clients.conf]]'''
