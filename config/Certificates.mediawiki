==Certificates==

===Configuration===

In Version 2.0 and later, the certificates are stored in the directory ''raddb/certs''.  The relevant files in that directory are

;README
:Simple HOWTO on certificate creation and EAP performance

;Makefile
:File containing rules to build certificates from the input configuration files.

;ca.cnf
:Configuration for sample certificate authority.

;server.cnf
:Configuration for sample server certificate.

;client.cnf
:Configuration for sample client certificate.  (Only needed for EAP-TLS.)

;xpextensions
:File hold magic OID's needed by Microsoft EAP clients.

===Generation===

Certificates may be created via a simple process:

 cd raddb/certs
 make

Then, start the server:

 radiusd -X

You should edit the certificate configuration files (see above) to meet your needs.  Then, do

 cd raddb/certs
 make

And the new certificates will be generated.  There is no need to run any special OpenSSL commands.

If you have generated certificates via some other process, simply put them in the ''raddb/certs'' directory, and edit the ''raddb/eap.conf'' file to point to your local certificates.
