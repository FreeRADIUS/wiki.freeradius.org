The '''clients''' file in the FreeRADIUS configuration directory (raddb/) used to contain the list of every client.

'''This file is obsolete and has been removed in all current releases.'''

The old-style FreeRADIUS needed to have clients (portmasters, Linux with portslave etc) configured in this file, and for every client, their "secret password".

Usually this was the same list as in the "[[naslist]]" file, but not every NAS is a client and not every client is a NAS.

'''This functionality is now in /etc/raddb/[[clients.conf]]'''
