I'm trying to add multiple groups to a user, but only the group with 
the highest priority (lowest number) is being processed. 
I've tried this on Freeradius 1.1.7, 2.0.4 and 2.1.1. 
When I set the priorities different only the first is processed. If I 
set the priority to the same level only the first entry in the 
database is processed. 

Do I need to enable this feature somewhere, or what? 


Cheers, 
JÃ¸rn
