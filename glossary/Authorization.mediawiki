[[Authorization]] refers to the granting of specific types of service (including "no service") to a user, based on their authentication, what services they are requesting, and the current system state. [[Authorization]] may be based on restrictions, for example time-of-day restrictions, or physical location restrictions, or restrictions against multiple logins by the same user.  Authorization determines the nature of the service which is granted to a user.  Examples of types of service include, but are not limited to: IP address filtering, address assignment, route assignment, [[QoS]]/differential services, bandwidth control/traffic management, compulsory tunnelling to a specific endpoint, and encryption.
