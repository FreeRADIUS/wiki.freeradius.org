[[PANA]] is a draft IETF protocol designed for network access [[authentication]]. As an [[EAP]] transport protocol, it is much like IEEE [[802.1X]] only it is more capable and runs on any link-layer. Currently PANA has support in Linux, FreeBSD and Windows. Please see http://panasec.org/docs/PANA-FAQ.txt for a detailed FAQ.

Note: PANA is not currently supported by [[FreeRADIUS]] but is supported by [[Open Diameter]]
