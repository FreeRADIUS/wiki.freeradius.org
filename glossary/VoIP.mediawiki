Voice over Internet Protocol, usually said as "Voice over IP" of "VOIP", is a telecommunications system that uses the Internet or other Internet Protocol network to transmit telephone calls. VoIP Gateways or Media Gateways are network devices that convert voice, fax, and other incoming calls between the public telephone network (PSTN) and an IP network. With a minimum of one Ethernet and telephone port yet expandable to fit the needs of any network configuration, gateways translate the varying coding techniques allowing companies to seamlessly communicate with other parties across other networks (VoIP or a standard phone service).
