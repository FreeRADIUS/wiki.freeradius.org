Accounting refers to the tracking of the consumption of [[NAS]] resources by users. This information may be used for management, planning, billing, or other purposes.  Real-time accounting refers to accounting information that is delivered concurrently with the consumption of the resources.  Batch accounting refers to accounting information that is saved until it is delivered at a later time.  Typical information that is gathered in accounting is the identity of the user, the nature of the service delivered, when the service began, and when it ended.
