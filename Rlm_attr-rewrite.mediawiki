	#  rewrite arbitrary packets.  Useful in accounting and authorization.
	#
	#
	#  The module can also use the Rewrite-Rule attribute. If it
	#  is set and matches the name of the module instance, then
	#  that module instance will be the only one which runs.
	#
	#  Also if new_attribute is set to yes then a new attribute
	#  will be created containing the value replacewith and it
	#  will be added to searchin (packet, reply, proxy, proxy_reply or config).
	# searchfor,ignore_case and max_matches will be ignored in that case.
	#
	# Backreferences are supported: %{0} will contain the string the whole match
	# and %{1} to %{8} will contain the contents of the 1st to the 8th parentheses
	#
	# If max_matches is greater than one the backreferences will correspond to the
	# first match
