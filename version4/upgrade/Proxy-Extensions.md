# Proxy Extensions

Proxying in version 4 has been extended with new functionality.  The biggest one is that proxying is a module `radius`, as discussed in the [[proxy]] page.

This page describes new functionality which was previously impossible in FreeRADIUS, but which is now trivial in version 4.
