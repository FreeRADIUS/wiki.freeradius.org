# Instructions for Developers

As the name suggests, FreeRADIUS is developed under the [GNU
General Public License, Version
2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) (GPLv2).
We invite anyone to use and contribute code to the project. The
following information should prove useful for potential
contributors.

## Patches and contributions

Development of FreeRADIUS is done using
[Github](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/). Please
submit issues, bugs, patches, etc. there. Additional instructions are on
[the wiki](http://wiki.freeradius.org/contributing/GitHub).


## Development mailing list

We encourage everyone who might contribute code to join the [FreeRADIUS
development list](http://www.freeradius.org/list/devel.html). This
list is highly technical and isn't for most users of the server.
For normal discussion of the server and how to use it, there's a
[FreeRADIUS user-list](http://www.freeradius.org/list/users.html).
You should *only* subscribe to the development list if you are
interested in writing software for the new server.


## Miscellaneous links

RADIUS [RFC's](http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/) and drafts: The two
most important are
[RFC2865](http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html) and
[RFC2866.](http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html). These are
the new RFCs, which replace the old ones,

[RFC2139](http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2139.txt)
