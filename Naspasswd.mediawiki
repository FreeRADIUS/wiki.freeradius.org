The '''naspasswd''' file in the FreeRADIUS configuration directory (raddb/) used to contain the list of passwords for some NAS (Network Access Server, also known as terminal server) equipment.

'''This file is obsolete and has been removed in all current releases.'''

The old-style FreeRADIUS used it if ”checkrad” needed to login on your terminal server to check who is on line on a certain port (i.e. it's not possible to use SNMP or finger). In that case one needed to define a login name and password here.

This was normally ONLY needed for USR/3Com Total Control, NetServer and Cyclades PathRAS terminal servers!

'''This functionality is now in /etc/raddb/[[clients.conf]]'''
