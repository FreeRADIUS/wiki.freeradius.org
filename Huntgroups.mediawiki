The '''huntgroups''' file is the FreeRADIUS configuration file that defines groups of clients (NASes) by default.

{{Default in the server source|raddb/huntgroups}}

This is usually located at /etc/raddb/huntgroups on a server system. Here you can define different huntgroups. These can be used to: 
*restrict access to certain huntgroups to certain users/groups of users (define this in the huntgroups file itself)
*match a login name with a huntgroup in /etc/raddb/[[users]]. One use for this is to give a user a static IP address based on the huntgroup / Point of Presence the user dials in to.

The parsing of the huntgroups file is activated by the module named '''preprocess'''.
