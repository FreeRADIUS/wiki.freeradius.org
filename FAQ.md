Hi,
I have working setup of openldap on CentOS 6.5.
I am new to freeradius.
I have installed freeradius version 3.0.11 on my server.
I want to configure freeradius with ldap authentication.
But I am getting an error like below:

" /usr/local/etc/raddb/mods-enabled/ldap[8]: Failed to link to module 'rlm_ldap': /usr/local/lib/rlm_ldap.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory "

I have freeradius-ldap installed on my server but its 2.2 version and still throws same error.

Thank you.
