==Very basic understanding==
EAP/MD5 and other types of EAP authentication are part of &quot;Port based network access control&quot;, as defined in the IEEE 802.1X standard. All you have to know at this time are the three main actors:

;Authentication Server (called [[AS]] or server in this document)
:[[AAA]] server ([[RADIUS]]) which will verify user credentials and give commands to accept or reject the user login request.

;authenticator (called client or access point - [[AP]] - in this document):
:the network access device ([[NAS]]), which will take the EAP-frames out of the traffic on one side and translate them into RADIUS-attributes on the other and vice versa, thus acting as pass-through device.

;supplicant (user)
:the one to be authenticated, i.e. your Windows/Linux whatever machine using the WLAN

==Server configuration==

Your server works, according to the [[Basic configuration HOWTO]].

<b>Assumptions:</b>
* You have a server that starts without any errors when doing '''''radiusd -s -X'''''

* You have at least one properly configured client (i.e. Access Point, [[AP]])

* You have at least one configured user and your '''radtest '''''user password''''' 10 '''''secret''''''' works from a test host (e.g. ''localhost''), i.e. you receive an Accept message from your server

Please take a look at the provided configuration files in order to accomplish
the setup so far. Its really not difficult to have the system configured
this way by just correcting the supplied configuration files. The files
concerned here are typically in the ''/etc/raddb/'' directory of your [[FreeRADIUS]] server:
* users
* clients.conf
* radiusd.conf

===User configuration (users)===
Alter the existent user or add another one which will be used for test
purposes. The simplest possible configuration is given in the example.
More complicated configurations are out of the scope of this document.

Example:

bob   Cleartext-Password := "Hello"


Note the '''":="''' operator. '''"="''' instead will not work.

====Sections (''radiusd.conf'')====

The interesting part here are ''authorize'' AND ''authenticate'' sections. (At the very bottom of the file.) Ignore all the following as those will deal with the accounting.

 authorize {
    preprocess
    files
    eap
 }

authenticate {
    eap
}

Finally, the EAP module itself has to be configured at least this way:
 eap {
    md5 {
    }
 }

'''Note''': EAP/MD5 will "just work" with default configuration.

Thats it for [[FreeRADIUS]]

==Client configuration==
===Windows XP as supplicant===
First of all: please read the documentation of your client. There are a
plenty of different clients on the market, we cant provide any help for
them. Basically, you have to activate &quot;Network port based 802.1X authentication&quot;,
sometimes called  similar. Please see the Technical
Documentation of your AP. Then, of course, you have to find the "Authentication Server" configuration part and supply the data about the used RADIUS server,

i.e. its IP-address, UDP-port and the pre-shared secret (the same one
you configured for your access point  client  in the [[FreeRADIUS]] configuration files). Sometimes you can supply a bunch of those servers
and sometimes you can use them for other purposes, too, like e.g. MAC-based
access control. You only have to activate the EAP-Authentication.
<p><i>Please note:</i> you can perfectly use EAP-authentication without using
WEP or providing whichever keys in the AP. Do it so for the test purposes.
Once youve got it running, you can setup your WEP keys, whatever. That
will allow you to analyze traffic if something goes wrong.

For Cisco AP350 it would look like following:
http://www.cisco.com/univercd/illus/6/55/65555.gif

Deactivate older authentication types (Open, Shared, CHAP, PAP, whatever)
to prevent misunderstanding during the test.

==User configuration==
===Windows XP (before SP1)===
'''Note:''' since WindowsXP SP1 you can't use EAP-MD5 for wireless devices!!! EAP-MD5 is only available for wired devices.

Go to the Network Connections window. Right-click the connection corresponding to the adapter which is going to use EAP authentication. Go to the "Authentication" tab. If it doesnt appear (yes, its weird sometimes) try to unplug and plug your adapter till it does (if PCMCIA...) Otherwise, download the software for the adapter configuration like e.g. ACU for the Cisco adapters and try to de- and reactivate the card.

In the Authentication dialog, assure the box &quot;Use IEEE802.1X network
authentication&quot; is checked. Set your EAP type there (EAP/MD5 Challenge).

Thats all. Now deactivate and reactivate your LAN-connection on this
adapter and it should work.

==Troubleshooting==

'''Problem 1:'''

Your AP keeps on saying "Unknown EAP authentication procedure request" or similiar all the time.

'''Workaround:'''

Try to assure that all the parameters described above (at client and user sides) have really been set. Then, try to check the following points:

*  The firmware of the network adapter and the access point are new enough to support the latest IEEE802.1X version (momentary Draft 10 or Draft 11 should work). Update your firmware with its radio part in the other case.

*  Use the adapter software to see which versions are active, verify the links, permutate all settings, do something! Try to use the adapter software to set the authentication type. In my case it was the first solution I had to set an ACU profile dictating the EAP authentication to the card instead of Allow Windows to set these parameters. This now works with Windows profiling, too, though.


'''Problem 2:'''

You get an Access Reject even if the identification information is correct.
In the server log you can see a weird Notification message.

'''Workaround:'''

In your user config (<code>users</code> file of the server configuration) 
remove the "Reply-Message" attribute for the concerned user. This is currently a bug.
Some APs (e.g. Cisco) send out a Notification downstream to the user on receiving 
a "Reply-Message" attribute in the "Radius Response". The Windows XP supplicant answers
with an "EAP Notification" type message instead of "EAP MD5 Challenge" message which should
be issued. <i><b>FreeRadius</b></i> server currently rejects every incoming EAP notification.

==Exchange and log examples==
Here is an example log of a successful user login

The basic exchange would be like following:
