==Overview==

[[FreeRADIUS]] is a modular, high performance and feature-rich [[RADIUS]] suite including [[radiusd|server]], [[radiusclient|clients]], development libraries and numerous additional [[RADIUS]] related utilities.

As the premiere open source RADIUS suite it is included as a [[standard package]] with numerous Operating Systems, has [[binary packages]] for many others and has source available which is known to [[build]] on almost anything. Production deployments include large scale installations comprising multiple [[AAA]] servers with over ten million users and millions of requests per day. It supports request [[proxy|proxying]], with [[fail-over]] and [[load balancing]], as well as the ability to access many types of back-end [[databases]]. Different classes of [[Authentication]] requests can trigger access of different [[Authentication]] and [[Authorization]] [[databases]] (with cascaded fall back), and [[Accounting]] records can be simultaneously recorded in multiple different storage [[databases]] and [[directories]].

[[Other RADIUS Servers]] are available.

We also keep a list of [[Acknowledgements]] of contributions to FreeRADIUS development.
