Authentication refers to the confirmation that a user who is requesting services is a valid user of the network services requested.  Authentication is accomplished via the presentation of an identity and credentials.  Examples of types of credentials are passwords, one-time tokens, digital certificates, and phone numbers (calling/called).

==Authentication methods==
The following authentication types are some of the methods which are supported by the server :
* Clear-text password in local configuration file (PAP) (cf. [[users]] file)
* Encrypted password in local configuration file
* CHAP
* MS-CHAP
* MS-CHAPv2
* Windows Domain Controller Authentication (via [[ntlm_auth]] and winbind)
* [[Proxy]] to another RADIUS server
* System authentication (usually through [[unix]] /etc/passwd)
* [[rlm_pam|PAM]] ([[PAM|Pluggable Authentication Modules]])
* [[rlm_ldap|LDAP]] ([[PAP]] only)
* [[rlm_pam|PAM]] ([[PAP]] only)
* [[rlm_cram|CRAM]]
* [[rlm_perl|Perl]] program
* [[rlm_python|Python]] program
* [[rlm_jradius|Java]] as a JRadius handler
* [[SIP]] [[Digest]] ([[Cisco]] [[VoIP]] boxes, [http://www.iptel.org/ser/ SER])
* A locally [[exec]]uted program. (like a CGI program.)
* Netscape-MTA-MD5 encrypted passwords
* [[rlm_krb5|Kerberos]] authentication
* X9.9 authentication token (e.g. [http://www.onlineshow.info CRYPTOCard])
* [[rlm_eap|EAP]] wireless with embedded authentication methods 
** EAP-MD5
** Cisco LEAP
** EAP-MSCHAP-V2 (as implemented by Microsoft),
** EAP-GTC
** EAP-SIM
** EAP-TLS
** EAP-TTLS (with any authentication protocol inside of the TLS tunnel)
** EAP-PEAP (with tunnelled EAP)
