Interoperability
================

With the number of deployments of the server, we can say with
confidence that the server is interoperable with the widest
possible range of devices and operating systems. In addition, we
follow all available [RFCs](http://freeradius.org/rfc/) and SDO
specifications.

Given the Open Source nature of the server, most vendors test
their products with FreeRADIUS before shipping them to their
customers. This practice is recommended, as there are well over
50,000 deployments of the server. It is very likely, therefore,
that customer using FreeRADIUS will buy vendor equipment. If the
equipment is not interoperable with FreeRADIUS, then those sales
will be lost.

There have been a number of cases in the past where a particular
vendor's product did not interoperate with the server.

*In almost every case the product failed to implement RADIUS correctly.*
We recognize that there may be [bugs](http://bugs.freeradius.org) in the
server. However, given the in-depth testing that the server receives
before every release, those bugs tend to be found quickly, and therefore
short-lived.
