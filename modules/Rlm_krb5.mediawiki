The '''rlm_krb5''' FreeRADIUS [[module]] enables the use of [[Kerberos]] 5.

== Compilation issues ==

{{Default in the server source|doc/rlm_krb5}}

=== MIT libraries ===

The rlm_krb5 module, by default, presumes you have the MIT Kerberos 5
distribution. Notes from that distribution:

On linux, you may have to change:

 deplibs_test_method="pass_all"

in <tt>../libtool</tt>

Otherwise, it complains if the krb5 libs aren't shared.

=== Heimdal libraries ===

If you are using the Heimdal Kerberos 5 distribution, pass a
<tt>--enable-heimdal-krb5</tt> to the configure line. With Heimdal, you'll need
to have a <tt>radius/your.hostname.example.org</tt> key in your keytab (which needs
to be readable by the user running the RADIUS server).

== Configuration parameters ==

{{Default in the server source|raddb/modules/krb5}}

You can configure the module with the following parameters:

 krb5 {

     # keytab containing the key used by rlm_krb5
     keytab = /path/to/keytab
    
     # principal that is used by rlm_krb5
     service_principal = radius/some.host.com
 }

Make sure the keytab is readable by the user that is used to run <tt>radiusd</tt> and that your authorization configuration really uses 
<tt>rlm_krb5</tt> to do the authentication.  You will need to add the following to the 'authenticate' section of your radiusd.conf file:

 Auth-Type Kerberos {
     krb5
 }
