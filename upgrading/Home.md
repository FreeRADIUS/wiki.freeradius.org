Information for upgrading between versions can be found in the ``raddb/README.rst`` file included with the default configuration installed by packages or provided as part of the src tarball.

**Note: It's usually easier to start with the default config for a major version, and transpose changes from the previous configuration.**

Instructions by version:

- [v2.2.x -> v3.0.x](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v3.0.x/raddb/README.rst).
- [v3.0.x -> v4.0.x](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v4.0.x/raddb/README.rst) with worked examples [here](/upgrading/version4/).
