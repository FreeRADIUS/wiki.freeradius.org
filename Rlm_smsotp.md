Smsotp (Short Message Service One Time Password) is a freeradius module written by Holger Wollf from Siemens which implements two-factor authentication using login/password and SMS: After the user logged in using the correct username and password, a SMS with a otp (one time password) is send to the user's phone. The user is required to enter the otp in order to successfully authenticate himeself.

# Architecture
Smsotp ships as a module which can be compiled and dynamically loaded. It connects to a unix domain socket where a daemon (smsotpd) listens. Holger Wollf did not provide his deamon,
so Thomas Glanzmann modified a perl POE (Perl Object Event) script to provide a smsotpd implementation. Smsotpd is contacted by the smsotp module after a user provided a valid username and password using PAP. It than sends the otp via SMS. Thomas Glanzmann used SIPGATE (a german VOIP provider) but any service can be used including a mobile phone by adopting the code in smsotpd. Afterwards the daemon is contacted again in order to verify that the provided otp is correct.
