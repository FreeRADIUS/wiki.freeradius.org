The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an Internet protocol for automating the configuration of computers that use TCP/IP. DHCP can be used to automatically assign IP addresses, to deliver TCP/IP stack configuration parameters such as the subnet mask and default router, and to provide other configuration information such as the addresses for printer, time and news servers.

The DHCP protocol is generally used on [[Ethernet]] and Ethernet-like networks (eg. [[WiFi]]) and should not be confused with assigning a dynamic IP address via some other method like [[PPP]] dialup.

FreeRADIUS has the ability to assign dynamic IP address to [[PPP]] users by using an [[IP Pool]] but does not currently include support the the DHCP protocol.
