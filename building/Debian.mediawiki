To install up-to-date FreeRADIUS packages on Debian stable systems, use the backports repository. For example:

* Add a [http://backports.debian.org/Mirrors/ backports mirror] to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> like this:

 deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main

* Update the package indices:

 sudo apt-get update

* Install FreeRADIUS packages:

 sudo apt-get -t lenny-backports install freeradius

* If everything went all right, make sure you will upgrade these from the same repository, by pinning it through <tt>/etc/apt/preferences</tt> like this:

<pre>
Package: freeradius
Pin: release a=lenny-backports
Pin-Priority: 500

Package: freeradius-common
Pin: release a=lenny-backports
Pin-Priority: 500

[...]
</pre>

Add whichever other FR package you are using to the list in the same format.
