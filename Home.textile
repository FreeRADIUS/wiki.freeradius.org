Welcome to the freeradius-server wiki!

Having started my journey with FR, I found it to be at times overwhelming and confusing.
It has come to my attention that there is a lot of hair-pulling and hand-wringing regarding the installation of this wonderful program.
There is a great need for good documentation concerning FR which will require a small level of commitment from those who are passionate about opensource and  the spread of technology in general. 
Following is a list of immediate requirements for the use of FR.
