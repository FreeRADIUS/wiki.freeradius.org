'''wpa_supplicant''' is a free software implementation of an [[IEEE 802.11i]] [[supplicant]] for [[Linux]], [[BSD]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. In addition to being a full-featured [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA2|WPA2]] supplicant, it also has support for [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] and older [[wireless LAN]] security protocols. Supported features include:

* WPA and full IEEE 802.11i/[[Robust Security Network|RSN]]/WPA2
* WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK (pre-shared key) ("[[Wi-Fi Protected Access#Security in pre-shared key mode|WPA-Personal]]")
* WPA with [[Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP]] (e.g., with [[RADIUS]] authentication server) ("WPA-Enterprise")
* key management for [[CCMP]], [[TKIP]], [[WEP]] (both 104/128 and 40/64 bit)
* RSN: PMKSA caching, pre-authentication

Included with the supplicant are:
* a graphical user interface
* a command-line interface utility for interacting with the running supplicant.

From either of these interfaces it is possible to review a list of currently visible networks, select one of them, provide any additional security information needed to authenticate with the network (e.g. a [[passphrase]] or [[username]] and [[password]]) and add it to the preference list to enable automatic reconnection in the future.

The graphical user interface is built on top of the Qt library from Trolltech.

The command-line tool <tt>eapol_test</tt> can be used to verify whether a FreeRADIUS server is responding to EAP authorization requests.

== EAP methods ==

Supported EAP methods include:

* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol#EAP-TLS|EAP-TLS]]
* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol#PEAP|EAP-PEAP]] (both PEAPv0 and PEAPv1)
* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol#EAP-TTLS|EAP-TTLS]]
* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol#EAP-SIM|EAP-SIM]]
* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol#EAP-AKA|EAP-AKA]]
* EAP-PSK (experimental)
* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol#EAP-FAST|EAP-FAST]]
* EAP-PAX
* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol#LEAP|LEAP]] (note: requires special support from the driver)
