The Trusted Network Connect Sub Group (TNC-SG) has defined and released an open architecture and a growing set of standards for endpoint integrity. The TNC architecture enables network operators to enforce policies regarding endpoint integrity at or after network connection. The standards ensure multi-vendor interoperability across a wide variety of endpoints, network technologies, and policies.
